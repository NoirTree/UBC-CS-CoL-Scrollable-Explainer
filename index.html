          <h2 class="title">Welcome!</h2>
          <p>
            In May 2022, some UBC Computer Science (CS) graduate students
            distributed surveys to the other students in the department to
            determine how well students were being supported by their current
            stipends. This explainer uses the survey data, and data from
            government and university websites to demonstrate the current cost
            of living situation in Vancouver (as of Dec 2022), see how students
            are being supported, and compare your own budget to that of an
            average CS graduate student. Scroll through the article for more
            information!

            So what expenses does a UBC CS grad student have?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Focusing on the basic expenses of a CS graduate student, this shows
            the average proportion of their expenses separated into housing,
            food, social activities, health, utilies, and commuting
            expenditures.

            How can we calculate inflation in Vancouver?
          </h2>
          The consumer price index (CPI) is a common econcomic metric used to
          measure the inflation rate in a certain economic market (such as
          Vancouver). It is a proportional metric used to compare prices of an
          item now to the price of the same item some years ago. For example, if
          a banana cost $2 in 2022, but now costs $4 in 2022. The CPI for the
          banana would be: 200. Note, there are not units for this metric.
        </section>
        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">Inflation Rate at British Columbia</h2>
          <p>
            Here we have the overaall CPI for British Columbia since 2016. The
            CPI calculated here is based on comparing prices of items to their
            original price in 2002. The visualization here depicts the overal
            upward trend of CPI indicating that inflation has been increasing
            since 2002.

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">The 12-month % change</h2>
          <p>
            An overall change of inflation over the course of 2 decades is not
            surprising. But let's compare the CPI change from year to year. In
            this visualization, we have how CPI has changed compared to the
            previous year. If you look at 2022, this rate is strikingly fast
            compared to previous years.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">Components</h2>
          <p>
            Let's look at the previous year a little most closely. In this graph
            every line represents the change in CPI from October 2021 to
            September 2022. We can calculate CPI for different components, such
            as food and hosuing. Looks like in August of 2022, clothing was
            overall less expensive than in August of 2021.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">Housing!</h2>
          <p>
            But housing has one of the highest 12-month CPI over the last year.
            A CPI of 8.26% means that if your rent was 1600$ last year, it will
            be
            <strong>1732$</strong>
            this year. This is particularly concerning for graduate students
            since housing is the largest monthly expense that students have.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">Food &amp; Transport</h2>
          <p>
            The price of food and transport has also risen. This means that if
            you bought a steak (<span>ðŸ¥©</span>) for 10$ last year, it will cost
            you 11$ this year!
          </p>
          <p>
            Transport (ðŸš—) has the the overall highest 12-month CPI. Transport
            is a relatively smaller portion of the average CS students' monthly
            budget. However, given these rapid increase
            <strong>you cannot choose to live too far away</strong> -- and rent
            is soaring!
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">OK. So what about the funding...</h2>
          The cost of living in vancouver is really scary. But a poor funding
          can make things worse...
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">Oh no!</h2>
          <p>
            From our survey, the funding of
            <span style="color: #db0b0b; font-weight: bold;">47.5%</span>
            graduate students at UBC CS department cannot offset basic expenses!
          </p>
          <p>Here, the funding means the sum of TA, RA, and awards.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">With support...</h2>
          <div class="scatter-final-content">
            <p>
              Some lucky ones get extra financial support, and some have
              internship as additional source of income. All students that
              <span style="color: #2fd3e9;">receive extra support</span> can
              afford basic expenses. Good for them!
            </p>
            <p>
              However, we notice that students that are
              <span style="color: #e61717;"
                >in urgent need for financial support</span
              >
              currently have no extra support available.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, even those with
              <span style="color: #4bc533;">"always enough"</span> funding, they
              are still very close to the boundary (y=x), which means that it is
              impossible to have saving.

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">We're feeling unsafe!</h2>
          <p>
            88.6% of the respondents are feeling unsafe in current grad stipend
            amount. This is so concerning -- Even students that can afford basic
            expenses with funding still feel unsafe!

          <h2 class="title">Are others also in struggle?</h2>
          <p>
            It will be a good excuse for UBC to ignore our struggle if graduates
            in other unviersities are in the same trouble. But is that the case?
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, we summarize the <strong>funding</strong> for PhD students in
            different unviersities. It seems that UBC is just in the middle.

            Boom! After adding the <strong>cost of living</strong>, the problem
