          <h2 class="title">Welcome!</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome! In May 2022, a survey created by UBC Computer Science (CS)
            graduate students was sent out to CS graduate students in the
            department to determine how well students were being supported by
            their current stipends. This article uses the survey data to allow
            you to learn about the current cost of living situation in Vancouver
            (as of Dec 2022), see how students are being supported, and compare
            your current budget to that of an average CS graduate student.
            Scroll through the article for more information!

            So what expenses does a UBC CS grad student have?

            CPI explain
          </h2>
          The meaning of CPI.
        </section>
        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">Inflation Rate at British Columbia</h2>
          <p>
            Can we add a section above this saying like: let's learn about the
            cost of living in vancouver. CPI is a common indicator of inflation
            rate. It is the ratio of (current price/price of the base period).
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can see, it seldom goes down over the last 6 years. Recently
            the index almost skyrockets -- not a good sign.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">12-month % change</h2>
          <p>
            A more informative indicator is the change of CPI compared to last
            year.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem is much more clear -- The growth rate increases
            dramatically in 2022!
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">Components</h2>
          <p>
            We can calculate CPI for different components, such as food and
            hosuing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's only focus on the last 1 year (Oct-21 to Sept-22). Seems like
            the only thing that is more affordable is clothing. But we don't buy
            clothes everyday, right?
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">Housing!</h2>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, üè†, the component that makes most of our basic
            expenses, has one of the highest 12-month CPI over the last year.
            8.26% means that if your rent is 1600$ last year, it will be
            <strong>1732$</strong>
            this year.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">Food &amp; Transport</h2>
          <p>
            The price of food also rises so much -- It means that if you buy a
            <span>ü•©</span> with 10$ last year, it will cost you 11$ this year!
          </p>
          <p>
            üöó has the highest 12-month CPI. Though it does not take up a huge
            amount of our basic expense, it means that
            <strong>you cannot choose to live too far away</strong> -- and rent
            is soaring!
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">OK. So what about the funding...</h2>
          The cost of living in vancouver is really scary. But a poor funding
          can make things worse...
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">Oh no!</h2>
          <p>
            From our survey, the funding of
            <span style="color: #db0b0b; font-weight: bold;">47.5%</span>
            graduate students at UBC CS department cannot offset basic expenses!
          </p>
          <p>Here, the funding means the sum of TA, RA, and awards.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">With support...</h2>
          <div class="scatter-final-content">
            <p>
              Some lucky ones get extra financial support, and some have
              internship as additional source of income. All students that
              <span style="color: #2fd3e9;">receive extra support</span> can
              afford basic expenses. Good for them!
            </p>
            <p>
              However, we notice that students that are
              <span style="color: #e61717;"
                >in urgent need for financial support</span
              >
              currently have no extra support available.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, even those with
              <span style="color: #4bc533;">"always enough"</span> funding, they
              are still very close to the boundary (y=x), which means that it is
              impossible to have saving.
            </p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">We're feeling unsafe!</h2>
          <p>
            88.6% of the respondents are feeling unsafe in current grad stipend
            amount. This is so concerning -- Even students that can afford basic
            expenses with funding still feel unsafe!
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="step">
          <h2 class="title">How about you?</h2>

          <h2 class="title">Are others also in struggle?</h2>
          <p>
            It will be a good excuse for UBC to ignore our struggle if graduates
            in other unviersities are in the same trouble. But is that the case?
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, we summarize the <strong>funding</strong> for PhD students in
            different unviersities. It seems that UBC is just in the middle.

          <p>
            Boom! After adding the <strong>cost of living</strong>, the problem
            arises!

            If we reorder using the left money, the UBC really "stands out"...
            in a negative way.
